Use poetry to manage dependencies and run the project; This includes installing dependencies, running tests, and building the project. For example, you can use the following commands:
```bash
poetry add <dependency>  # To add a new dependency
poetry run python <script.py>  # To run a script
```

When using a Jupyter notebook, you should prefer modifying already existing cells instead of adding new ones. This helps keep the notebook clean and organized. If you need to add a new cell for your internal reasoning process, make sure to delete it before finalizing your work. You can add new cells if I asked you for very new code that doesn't fit in any existing cell, but if I just asked you to modify existing code adding or changing a few lines, you should do it in the existing cells.

In every code, do not overengineer. Write the minimum amount of code necessary to solve the problem. Avoid adding unnecessary features or complexity. Be concise and to the point.
